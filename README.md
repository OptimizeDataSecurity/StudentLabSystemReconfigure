<h1>Student Lab - Server & Desktop  Reconfiguration</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
With a comprehensive skill set spanning Active Directory administration, cyber threat monitoring, and vulnerability management, I seamlessly orchestrated the setup of a cutting-edge computer lab for educational workshops. Leveraging advanced PowerShell Automation techniques, I ensured the integration of Active Directory, guaranteeing seamless user authentication and efficient group policy management. The vigilant use of tools like Azure Sentinel fortified the lab's security against real-time cyber threats, while proficiency in Nessus Essential facilitated thorough risk assessments and prompt remediation. Demonstrating networking expertise in TCP/IP, I established a robust foundation with impeccable installation, configuration, and maintenance of DHCP and DNS systems. Mastery in server environments, including Server 2016/19, Mac OSX, Office 365, and Windows 10/11, translated into an expertly managed ecosystem, complemented by award-winning customer service and incident management. I further performed hardware setup, diagnosis, and upgrade proficiency, including network systems installation and oversight of the system and network security. Application installation, service desk support through a ticket system, and technical troubleshooting added to the holistic approach, creating a comprehensive and well-rounded learning environment. The incorporation of cloud computing, networking, and security, along with expertise in virtual private network configuration, VMWare, and Hyper-V configuration, is on the horizon for this Lab & to enhance the lab's capabilities. A commitment to staying at the forefront of the IT landscape ensures the lab reflects the latest industry trends, providing students with a secure and dynamic learning environment.
